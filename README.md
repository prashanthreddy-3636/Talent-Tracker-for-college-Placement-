The Talent Tracker for College (Placement) project helps colleges keep track of studentsâ€™ placement details in an easy and organized way. It is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to add student information, check their placement status, and view or filter the student list. Users can also edit or delete student records, and the data is saved in the browser using LocalStorage. This project is a basic version that can be improved later by adding login, backend connection, and more features.
